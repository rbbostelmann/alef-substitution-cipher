# alef-substitution-cipher

The cipher is working fine, but it can certainly be upgraded. It doesn't actually map all of the keyboard keys (none, actually), but rather uses a dictionary and loops through it. I've become aware that there are more elegant and time-saving ways of implementing that, all of which might be used in future similar projects.
